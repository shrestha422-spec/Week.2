line = """Every day we face new experiences in our lives.
These experiences change our thoughts, behavior, and decisions.
Life is not always the same; sometimes we feel joy, and sometimes we face challenges.
Challenges make us stronger and increase our confidence.
A person becomes successful only when they learn from their mistakes.
Improving ourselves little by little every day is important.
Even if dreams are big, we must move forward with patience.
Hard work and consistency open the door to success.
With self-belief, even the impossible becomes possible.
A positive attitude makes our life more beautiful."""
